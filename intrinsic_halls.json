And the Supreme Court has never weighed in on the constitutionality of these limits, either. So there is ample legal room to press the issue. If the Supreme Court agrees with us that these limits are constitutional, we can end the influence of super PACs nationwide, and thank these Alaskans for taking up this important fight with us. ((The Citizens United case was argued in 2009 and decided in 2010. The court held 5-4 that the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political campaigns by corporations, including nonprofit corporations, labor unions, and other associations. So the above citation describes a legal \"hope\" but not an ongoing case.))"
