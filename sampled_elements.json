While we have been able to explore the moon in detail using robotic spacecraft and human missions, exploring the deep ocean poses many technical challenges. The extreme pressure, darkness, and vastness of the ocean floor make it difficult to explore and study. In addition, the ocean covers over 70 percent of the Earth's surface, and much of it is remote and difficult to access. This has made it difficult and expensive to conduct deep sea research and exploration. While the entire ocean floor has been mapped [1], only a small percentage has been explored in detail, and much of what lies beneath the ocean's surface remains a mystery.",

Major league players vote for eight position players in each league, plus the designated hitter for the AL, as well as five starting pitchers and three relievers. The Commissioner's Office is responsible for finishing out the roster, selecting eight players in the NL and six in the AL.[1][2][3]",
